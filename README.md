#  ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

  

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This is my first time participating and I will be taking on the daily challenges throughout December. Iâ€™ll do my best to complete as many puzzles as possible, but I may not make it all the way â€” but it's the spiritual journey that counts!

In this repository, youâ€™ll find:

- My solutions implemented mostly in **C++** with the use of some parser generators.
- A focus mix of handmade old-school, modern, lazy, fast, slow and strange approaches.

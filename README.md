#  🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

  

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This is my first time participating and I will be taking on the daily challenges throughout December. I’ll do my best to complete as many puzzles as possible, but I may not make it all the way — but it's the spiritual journey that counts!

In this repository, you’ll find:

- My solutions implemented mostly in **C++**
- A mix of handmade old-school, modern, lazy, fast, slow and strange approaches.

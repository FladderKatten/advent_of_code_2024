# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This is my first time participating and I will be taking on the daily challenges throughout December. While Iâ€™ll do my best to complete as many puzzles as possible, but I may not make it all the way â€” but it's the spiritual  journey is what counts!

## ðŸ“œ Description

Advent of Code is a yearly coding event with fun and challenging puzzles released daily during December. Each puzzle tests problem-solving skills and programming knowledge. 

In this repository, youâ€™ll find:
- My solutions implemented mostly in **C++** with the use of some parser generators.
- A focus mix of handmade old-school, modern, lazy, fast, slow but most of all unique approaches.
